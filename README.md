# HashMap

Through this project, I gained practical experience in:

- Understanding the core concepts of a HashMap (or HashTable).
- Implementing the foundational structure using buckets and managing capacity.
- Developing and applying a hashing function to map keys to array indices.
- Handling collisions where different keys hash to the same index.
- Implementing essential methods for interacting with the map, such as:
  - Setting and updating key-value pairs (`set`).
  - Retrieving values by key (`get`).
  - Checking for key existence (`has`).
  - Removing entries (`remove`).
  - Getting the size (`length`).
  - Clearing the map (`clear`).
  - Retrieving all keys, values, or entries (`keys`, `values`, `entries`).
- Understanding and implementing automatic resizing based on a load factor to maintain performance.

This project served as a valuable learning exercise to solidify my understanding of this fundamental data structure and its internal workings.
